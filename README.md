## BIO

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Garry! Born and raised in Durham, NC, U.S - home to some of the biggest [colleges](https://www.discoverdurham.com/community-culture/colleges/), [amazing food](https://www.discoverdurham.com/food-drink/), and a [emerging tech city!](https://www.wraltechwire.com/2021/04/27/study-durham-ranks-no-2-raleigh-no-7-as-best-cities-to-start-a-business/)

Before being immersed in all things startup, I worked in the non-profit space for over five years, at a local YMCA running the operations of an after school program and summer camp. I feel like
if you can work with middle school aged kids, you literally can work with anyone! ü§£ Those were some great years where I really built on my soft skills: having patience, effective communication, and 
maintaining the highlest level of responsibility, just to name a few! üòÖ

I jumped head first into a startup through a connection from a friend and hadn't looked back since. [First.io](https://www.first.io/), is a predictive analytics platform that helps real estate agents
prioritize the deals in their network by buidling relationships backed by a predictive scoring model. I can geek out about how cool this technology is and happy to do so if you're 
interested, too! Being the 11th employee, I had the opportunity to build out the customer success team, while also providing value in other areas of the business. My time at First
spanned over four years and I'm forever grateful to have been a part of an amazing team, who built an even greater product and was acquired by real estate giant RE/MAX.

Outside of work, I spend my time baking yummy desserts, dog parking with my furry friend, Jax or binging the latest Netflix series!

## MY ROLE

That same friend led me to my current role .. I know, she's amazing ‚ò∫Ô∏è! 

I lead the programmatic strategy for programs and events at [American Underground](https://americanunderground.com/). The AU is a tech hub providing startups not only space, but access to resources, connections, 
content, and mentors that support their growth journey! I've led some of our global programs and am grateful for the impact of the work we're doing has on the startups and entrepreneurs
who need them most.

Because I err on the side of speed, I strive to ensure that the details, quality, and execution of my work are always clear and concise

## WHAT I VALUE MOST

*Empathy

*Transparency

*Collaboration

*Give First Mentality

*Diverse perspectives

*Doing the thing. Iterate. Keep going


## HOW TO WORK WITH ME

*I love a meeting agenda. I also love to maximize 30min meetings vs anything longer, unless its necessary

*I always tend to look up when I'm thinking or brainstorming, promise Im engaged, just gathering my thoughts before speaking

*I genuinely care about the people I work with and how they are doing personally. I love to listen and will share thoughts if you ask

*I white board a lot, mainly for smaller tasks and random thoughts that I don't want to forget. It's also helpful in strategic meetings. I love a visual

*I've learned to create boundaries well with my first startup and will respect yours too. I set slack notifications to work hours only and probably won't check
them on the weekend. Outside of that, I'm prompt if you need me!
